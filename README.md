# Image Enhancement Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to enhance low-quality or degraded images using a neural network architecture. The aim is to learn a mapping from low-resolution or noisy images to high-quality images through supervised learning.

## Features

- Preprocessing and loading of image datasets
- Data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for image enhancement
- Training loop with loss tracking and visualization
- Model evaluation and image output comparison
- Save and load trained models

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

This model expects pairs of low-quality and high-quality images. Ensure your dataset is organized in two folders:

```
dataset/
├── low_res/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   └── ...
└── high_res/
    ├── image1.jpg
    └── ...
```

These image pairs must correspond to each other in naming and alignment for supervised learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

### Training the Model

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Place your dataset in the appropriate folder structure.
3. Open `image.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.
4. The model will be trained and evaluated automatically.

### Output

- Enhanced images are displayed side-by-side with their original counterparts for visual comparison.
- Trained models are saved in `.h5` format and can be reused for inference.

## Model Architecture

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for image-to-image translation tasks. It includes:

- Multiple Conv2D layers
- Activation functions (e.g., ReLU)
- Downsampling and upsampling
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated qualitatively by visualizing the enhanced image against the original and low-quality versions. Future improvements may include using PSNR or SSIM as quantitative metrics.

## Improvements and Future Work

- Implement PSNR and SSIM metrics for more objective evaluations.
- Introduce GAN-based architecture for perceptually better results.
- Use larger datasets and batch training for higher quality output.
- Deploy the model via a web application or API.
